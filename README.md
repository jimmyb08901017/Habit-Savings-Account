# Habit Saving Account

This app is created using expo(React-Native), expo-router and Typescript.

There are five main data structures:
**Account** act as bank,
**Habit** for daily habit,
**SpecialIncome** for non-daily income,
**Product** for purchases,
**TransactionRecord** for Account records.

- How to choose the right UI library that suits you?
  https://docs.expo.dev/ui-programming/user-interface-libraries/
  Just choose the one you like in this. Among these, I use gluestick-ui
  because it is more beautiful (and has more Github⭐️).
